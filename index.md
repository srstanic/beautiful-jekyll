Software development is difficult
---------------------------------

If you have a software development team in your organization you have probably already learned that software development is difficult.

Projects are often late, deliverables donâ€™t always meet the expectations, and other companies are poaching your best people.

And if you talk with individual team members, they might tell you that management is clueless about how the software is built. They feel that their hard work is not valued. The unreasonable expectations set by their bosses kill their motivation.

Difficult doesn't mean impossible
--------------------
Obviously, there are many challenges in the software development process and in my experience most of them are surmountable. It may take time and effort but it always pays off in the long run.

If you are looking for help in making your software development team more efficient and reliable, I would love to hear more about your struggles and help you overcome them.
